# Complete wysiwyg for the [Panopoly](https://www.drupal.org/project/panopoly) distribution.

We use this in lieu of the Panopoly Wysiwyg. These are the settings we have found to be most valuable.

This also contains the latest [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/) that works with the [Media](https://www.drupal.org/project/media) module.

It contains a make file that will download the CKEditor library and provides patches to the [Wysiwyg](https://www.drupal.org/project/wysiwyg) module.
